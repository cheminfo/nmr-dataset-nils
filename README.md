In this set of exercises, you will find combined 1D and 2D NMR spectra for small, organic molecules of increasing complexity.
(1) Always, a molecular formula is given which allows to calculate the degree of unsaturation. 
(2) Spectra should be analyzed by deriving basic information (chemical shift, signal intensity, spin systems/coupling) from 1H NMR.
(3) H,C assignment can be performed with the provided HMQC or HSQC (1J) correlation experiments, missing 13C signals should be extracted
by comparison of 1J correlation and HMBC (long range): Cross peaks without 1J correlation originate from quaternary carbons. 
(4) In several cases, additional information (NOE contacts, heteronuclear experiments) is provided.
(5) To check your answer, finally click the 'draw answer' button and draw the proposed structure.
